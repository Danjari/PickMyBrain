## Learning Steps

### Step 1: Project Setup & Understanding
**Goal**: Understand the project requirements and set up your development environment

**Tasks**:
1. Read through the PRD carefully - what are the key features?
2. Research FastAPI vs Flask for the backend choice
3. Research React vs Next.js for the frontend choice
4. Set up your development environment (Python, Node.js, code editor)
5. Create the basic folder structure above

**Learning Questions**:
- Why did we choose FastAPI over Flask?
- What are the benefits of React for this project?
- How will the backend and frontend communicate?

### Step 2: Backend Foundation
**Goal**: Create the basic FastAPI application structure

**Tasks**:
1. Create `backend/requirements.txt` with necessary dependencies
2. Create `backend/app/config.py` to handle environment variables
3. Create `backend/app/main.py` with basic FastAPI setup
4. Test that your FastAPI server runs locally

**Key Concepts to Learn**:
- FastAPI basics (routing, dependency injection)
- Environment variable management with pydantic-settings
- Python virtual environments

### Step 3: NLP Processing
**Goal**: Build the email analysis logic

**Tasks**:
1. Create `backend/app/nlp_processor.py`
2. Implement regex-based phrase detection
3. Create a scoring system for confidence levels
4. Test with sample email content

**Key Concepts to Learn**:
- Regular expressions in Python
- Text processing and pattern matching
- Confidence scoring algorithms

### Step 4: Email Integration
**Goal**: Connect to email services and process emails

**Tasks**:
1. Research Gmail API vs IMAP for email access
2. Create `backend/app/email_analyzer.py`
3. Implement email fetching logic
4. Add auto-reply functionality

**Key Concepts to Learn**:
- Gmail API authentication
- Email protocols (IMAP/SMTP)
- Async programming with Python

### Step 5: Frontend Foundation
**Goal**: Create the React landing page

**Tasks**:
1. Set up React project with `Vite` (already done!)
2. Create the humorous landing page component
3. Add styling and animations
4. Test the payment link flow

**Key Concepts to Learn**:
- React component lifecycle with TypeScript
- CSS animations and styling
- State management basics
- Vite development workflow

### Step 6: Integration & Testing
**Goal**: Connect backend and frontend, test the full flow

**Tasks**:
1. Connect frontend to backend APIs
2. Test the complete email â†’ analysis â†’ reply â†’ landing page flow
3. Add error handling and logging
4. Optimize performance

**Key Concepts to Learn**:
- API integration
- Error handling
- Testing strategies

### Step 7: Deployment & Polish
**Goal**: Deploy the application and add final touches

**Tasks**:
1. Deploy backend to Heroku/Railway
2. Deploy frontend to Vercel/Netlify
3. Set up production environment variables
4. Add monitoring and analytics

**Key Concepts to Learn**:
- Deployment strategies
- Environment management
- Production considerations

## Tips for Learning
1. **Start Small**: Don't try to build everything at once
2. **Test Often**: Write small tests for each component
3. **Read Documentation**: Don't just copy code, understand it
4. **Ask Questions**: Research concepts you don't understand
5. **Iterate**: Your first version won't be perfect, and that's okay!
